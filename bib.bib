  abstract = {Bootstrap methods are computer-intensive methods of statistical analysis, which use simulation to calculate standard errors, confidence intervals, and significance tests. The methods apply for any level of modelling, and so can be used for fully parametric, semiparametric, and completely nonparametric analysis. This 1997 book gives a broad and up-to-date coverage of bootstrap methods, with numerous applied examples, developed in a coherent way with the necessary theoretical basis. Applications include stratified data; finite populations; censored and missing data; linear, nonlinear, and smooth regression models; classification; time series and spatial problems. Special features of the book include: extensive discussion of significance tests and confidence intervals; material on various diagnostic methods; and methods for efficient computation, including improved Monte Carlo simulation. Each chapter includes both practical and theoretical exercises. S-Plus programs for implementing the methods described in the text are available from the supporting website.},

  title = {Forecasting, structural time series models and the {Kalman} filter},
  doi = {10.1017/cbo9781107049994},
  abstract = {In this book, Andrew Harvey sets out to provide a unified and comprehensive theory of structural time series models. Unlike the traditional ARIMA models, structural time series models consist explicitly of unobserved components, such as trends and seasonals, which have a direct interpretation. As a result the model selection methodology associated with structural models is much closer to econometric methodology. The link with econometrics is made even closer by the natural way in which the models can be extended to include explanatory variables and to cope with multivariate time series. From the technical point of view, state space models and the Kalman filter play a key role in the statistical treatment of structural time series models. The book includes a detailed treatment of the Kalman filter. This technique was originally developed in control engineering, but is becoming increasingly important in fields such as economics and operations research. This book is concerned primarily with modelling economic and social time series, and with addressing the special problems which the treatment of such series poses. The properties of the models and the methodological techniques used to select them are illustrated with various applications. These range from the modellling of trends and cycles in US macroeconomic time series to to an evaluation of the effects of seat belt legislation in the UK.},

  abstract = {Both state-space models and Markov switching models have been highly productive paths for empirical research in macroeconomics and finance. This book presents recent advances in econometric methods that make feasible the estimation of models that have both features. One approach, in the classical framework, approximates the likelihood function; the other, in the Bayesian framework, uses Gibbs-sampling to simulate posterior distributions from data.
  The authors present numerous applications of these approaches in detail: decomposition of time series into trend and cycle, a new index of coincident economic indicators, approaches to modeling monetary policy uncertainty, Friedman's "plucking" model of recessions, the detection of turning points in the business cycle and the question of whether booms and recessions are duration-dependent, state-space models with heteroskedastic disturbances, fads and crashes in financial markets, long-run real exchange rates, and mean reversion in asset returns.},

  abstract = {As in past volumes, the current volume of Advances in Clinical Child Psychology strives for a broad range of timely topics on the study and treatment of children, adolescents, and families. Volume 18 includes a new array of contributions covering issues pertaining to treatment, etiolÂ­ ogy, and psychosocial context. The first two contributions address conduct problems. Using qualitative research methods, Webster-Stratton and Spitzer take a unique look at what it is like to be a parent of a young child with conduct problems as well as what it is like to be a participant in a parent training program. Chamberlain presents research on residential and foster-care treatment for adolescents with conduct disorder. As these chapters well reflect, Webster-Stratton, Spitzer, and Chamberlain are all veterans of programmatic research on treatment of child and adolescent conduct problems. Wills and Filer describe an emerging stress-coping model that has been applied to adolescent substance use and is empirically well justified. This model has implications for furthering intervention strategies as well as enhancing our scientific understanding of adolescents and the development of substance abuse. Foster, Martinez, and Kulberg confront the issue that researchers face pertaining to race and ethnicity as it relates to our understanding of peer relations. This chapter addresses some of the measurement and conceptual challenges relative to assessing ethnic variables and relating these to social cognitions of peers, friendship patterns, and peer acceptance.},

  title = {Analysis of incomplete multivariate data},
  doi = {10.1201/9780367803025},
  isbn = {9780367803025},
  abstract = {The last two decades have seen enormous developments in statistical methods for incomplete data. The EM algorithm and its extensions, multiple imputation, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo provide a set of flexible and reliable tools from inference in large classes of missing-data problems. Yet, in practical terms, those developments have had surprisingly little impact on the way most data analysts handle missing values on a routine basis.
  Analysis of Incomplete Multivariate Data helps bridge the gap between theory and practice, making these missing-data tools accessible to a broad audience. It presents a unified, Bayesian approach to the analysis of incomplete multivariate data, covering datasets in which the variables are continuous, categorical, or both. The focus is applied, where necessary, to help readers thoroughly understand the statistical properties of those methods, and the behavior of the accompanying algorithms.
  All techniques are illustrated with real data examples, with extended discussion and practical advice. All of the algorithms described in this book have been implemented by the author for general use in the statistical languages S and S Plus. The software is available free of charge on the Internet.},

In addition to the long-term health implications of cigarette smoking and alcohol use (e.g., Helzer, 1987; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1988), adolescent substance use is of concern to clinical psychology both because early onset of substance use has prognostic significance for later substance abuse problems (Robins \& Przybeck, 1985) and because substance use tends to be correlated with other problem behaviors, including aggressive and depressive symptomatology (e.g., see Cole \& Carpentieri, 1990; Loeber, 1988). Thus, research aimed at a better understanding of adolescent substance use has relevance for informing research on other types of child behavior problems.},
