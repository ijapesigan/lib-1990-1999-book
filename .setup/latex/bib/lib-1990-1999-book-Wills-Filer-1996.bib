  abstract  = {The goal of this chapter is to discuss research on adolescent substance use from the perspective of a stress-coping model. In addition to the long-term health implications of cigarette smoking and alcohol use (e.g., Helzer, 1987; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1988), adolescent substance use is of concern to clinical psychology both because early onset of substance use has prognostic significance for later substance abuse problems (Robins \& Przybeck, 1985) and because substance use tends to be correlated with other problem behaviors, including aggressive and depressive symptomatology (e.g., see Cole \& Carpentieri, 1990; Loeber, 1988). Thus, research aimed at a better understanding of adolescent substance use has relevance for informing research on other types of child behavior problems.},
